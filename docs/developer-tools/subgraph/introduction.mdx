Enso uses a subgraphs for indexing and organizing data from the Enso smart contracts. 
The Enso Subgraph is hosted on The Graph hosted service and can be used to query Enso data.
It syncs with the blockchain and indexes pertinent on-chain data about Enso's smart contracts.
It also provides an easy to use GraphQL interface for developers to easily query synced data from the Ethereum blockchain.

The source code for the Enso Subgraph is available [here](https://github.com/enso/enso-subgraph).

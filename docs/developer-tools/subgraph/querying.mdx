# Querying the Enso Subgraph

---

This doc will teach you how to query Enso analytics by writing GraphQL queries on the subgraph. You can fetch data points like :

- [Strategies info, TVL and prices](#strategy-info)
- [Historical data for strategies and managers](#historical-data)
- [Strategies state changes: rebalance and restructure](#strategy-structure-changes)

and much more. Below are some example queries. To run a query copy and paste it into the [enso explorer](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/enso/enso-v1) to get fresh data.

You can play around with the Enso Subgraph using The Graph's online [sandbox](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/enso/enso-v1).

To programmatically query the Enso Subgraph you can send queries to:

`https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/enso/enso-v1`

## Strategies Informations queries

---

Strategy created on enso. Each strategy is Tokenizes as an ERC20.

## Strategy Info

```graphql
{
  strategy(id: "") {
    id
    manager
    name
    symbol
    state {
      threshold
      social
      fee
      slippage
      timelock
    }
    nav
    tvl
    items {
      token {
        id
        name
      }
      percentage
      balance
    }
    totalSupply
  }
}
```

### Strategies by Manager

```graphql
{
  strategy(where: { manager: "" }) {
 id
    manager
    name
    symbol
    state {
      threshold
      social
      fee
      slippage
      timelock
    }
    nav
    tvl
    items {
      token {

        name
      }
      percentage
      balance
    }
    totalSupply
  }
}
```

### Manager

```graphql
{
  manager(id: "") {
    strategiesCount
    strategies {
      id
      name
    }
    tvl
    totalNav
    commonItems {
      id
      token
      strategy
      percentage
    }
    managerDaysData {
      id
      manager
      timestamp
      tvlLastTracked
      totalNavLastTracked
      strategiesAverageNav
      holdersCount
    }
  }
}
```

## Historical Data

```graphql
{
  strategyDaysData(where: { strategy: "" }) {
    id
    strategy
    timestamp
    tvlLastTracked
    navLastTracked
    holdersCount
    }
}
```

## Strategy structure changes

### Rebelances by strategy

```graphql
{
  rebalance(id: "") {
    id
    txHash
    strategy
    timestamp
    before
    after
  }
}
```

### Restructure by strategy

```graphql
{
  restructure(id: "") {

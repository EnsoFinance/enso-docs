##### Liquidity Migration Contracts for Enso Vampire Attack

---

## ENSO Liquidity Migration Contracts

Refer to [Vampire attack guide](../../guides/vampire-attack.mdx) prior to reading this documentation, and our ![medium article](https://medium.com/ensofinance/vampire-attack-6-protocols-8d1a1454ec3f).

Indicies are staked in the `LiquidityMigration` contract, which updates staked value for each staker.  Stake cannot be undone, and indicies will be unwrapped when migration occurs.  Migration can only occur by calling `migrate()` from the Enso Multisig.  In emergecy cases, Enso Multisig has right to call `refund()` only a particular stakers index which transfers the staked amount directly back to the stakers wallet.

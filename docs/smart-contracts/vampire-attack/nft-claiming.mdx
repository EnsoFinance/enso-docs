##### An introduction to claiming Enso 1155 NFTs

## NFT Claim

Custom contact, enabling users who have Staked token from 6 victims on [LiquidityMigration contracts](liquidity-migration.mdx) to claim NFT.  Each victim has it's own unique NFT, and can be viewed on the [Vampire Attack guide](../../guides/vampire-attack.mdx).  When you have staked on [Liquidity Migration Contract](https://github.com/EnsoFinance/liquidity-migration/blob/master/contracts/LiquidityMigration.sol#L60), you can call `Claim()` on [Claimable](https://github.com/EnsoFinance/liquidity-migration/blob/master/contracts/nft/Claimable.sol#L59) with the associated index/LP token you have staked, and also the adapter address for the victim(addresses can be seen below).   

Claiming is only available prior to migration.

##### Claimable
- Transfers from appoval of multisig NFT
- 1 NFT per victim(6)
- Stake all 6 to get a master NFT, and surprise reveal
- Batch functionality for claiming all NFTs
- Burn all remaining approvals remaining from multisig when migration occurs

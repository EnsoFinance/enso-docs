##### A ProtocolOracle is an oracle that will wrap an external on-chain oracle service and provide token estimates using that service.

---

## Consult
All protocol oracles must implement the `consult()` function which takes an amount and a token address and returns it's value in WETH.

## Uniswap V3
The `UniswapV3Oracle` uses the pool with highest liquidity and estimates the price based on an average across a time window in order reduce price manipulation via flash loans or front-running.

## Chainlink
The `ChainlinkOracle` uses Chainlink to determine the price of a token. For tokens not priced in WETH, it is able to estimate across multiple Chainlink oracles to determine the WETH price.

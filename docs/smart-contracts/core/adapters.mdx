##### An Adapter is a contract that adapts the smart contracts of an exchange, yield farm, or other DeFi protocol to a common interface that allows it to be used by a Router contract.

---

## Whitelist
The [StrategyProxyFactory](factory) contract holds the address of the platform's current `Whitelist` contract. Anytime a contract attempts to interact with an adapter, it first must lookup the `Whitelist` contract and check whether the address has been approved. The whitelist is managed by Enso Finance and the community.


## Swap
All adapters must implement the `swap()` function in order to be usable by [Router](routers/routers-overview) contracts. Since it is expected that the [Router](routers/routers-overview) will interact with the `swap()` function via a delegate call the adapter's state variables (such as external contract addresses) must be defined in the deployment bytecode as `constant` or `immutable` variables.

## Exchanges
Enso supports the following DEXes: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Sushi, Balancer, Curve, and Synthetix. Interacting with these adapters allows a strategy to trade one token for another.

## Liquidity Pools
Enso supports the following LPs: Uniswap V2, Sushi, and Curve. Interacting with these adapters allows a strategy to provide liquidity and passively earn trading fees.

## Vaults
Enso supports YEarn and Curve Gauge Rewards.

## Lending
Enso supports Aave and Compound for lending tokens in order to earn interest.

## Borrowing
Enso supports Aave for borrowing tokens for complex strategies such as getting into leveraged positions.
